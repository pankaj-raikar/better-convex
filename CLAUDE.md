## 🚨 CRITICAL: MUST READ BEFORE ANY TASK

**IMPORTANT**: The following sections define mandatory prerequisites for specific types of work. Failure to read these files once per session will result in incorrect implementations. This is NOT optional.

### Convex Backend Work

**Files**: `convex/**`
**MANDATORY**: Read `.cursor/rules/convex.mdc` FIRST

## Development

### Commands

DO NOT run `pnpm dev`, or `pnpm build` or `pnpm start` unless asked.

- `pnpm typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking (must pass without errors) on each task end. Do not run this unless you can't see it in Background Bash Shells.
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Run ESLint and fix linting errors on precommit (not on each task end)
- **NEVER make git commits unless explicitly asked by the user.**

### Agents

Specialized sub-agents are automatically picked by Claude. Each operates with its own context window and focused expertise.

**@ References Rule**: When using sub-agents with @ references in the prompt, the sub-agent MUST use the Read tool to read ALL @ referenced files before starting any task. Sub-agents cannot automatically access @ referenced content like the main context can.
